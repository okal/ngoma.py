Overview
--------

Ngoma.py is a fun project to create an MPlayer clone in python. I do not have
a clear idea how it will evolve, just a toy project to learn more about python.
Fork the code if you find it useful/fun.

Where it's at
-------------

All you can do with ngoma now is read the tags of an MP3 file.
