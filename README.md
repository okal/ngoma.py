Overview
--------

Ngoma.py is a fun project to create an MPlayer clone in python. I do not have
a clear idea how it will evolve, just a toy project to learn more about python.
Fork the code if you find it useful/fun.

Requirements
------------

Ngoma.py has the following dependencies

[pygame](http://pygame.org/) - The mixer package is used for mp3 file playback
[mutagen](http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/) - Used to read the ID3 tags

Where it's at
-------------

In it's current form, Ngoma.py can playback mp3 files and read their metadata.
