Overview
--------

Ngoma.py is a fun project to create an MPlayer clone in python. I do not have
a clear idea how it will evolve, just a toy project to learn more about python.
Fork the code if you find it useful/fun.

Where it's at
-------------

In it's current form, Ngoma.py can playback mp3 files and read their metadata.
